Welcome to Stuki.  

Stuki is a ZF2 EAV engine.  Entity, Attribute, Value data stores are key - value
stores and often referred to as an antipattern.  For that reason included with 
this distribution is StuQL 0.2, a sql query engine for the dynamic attribute 
sets (tables/entity) and attributes (table columns) you create with Stuki using
it's renderers to format any kind of text data.  Binary data is handled with 
plugins.  See Attachments/Attachments.  For instance, I created a GoogleDocs 
renderer to store the doc id in an EAV field on the form then when the value is 
rendered it replaces the data with an iframe.
