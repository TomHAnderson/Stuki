Welcome to Stuki.  

Stuki is a ZF2 EAV engine.  Entity, Attribute, Value data stores are key - value
stores and often referred to as an antipattern.  For that reason included with 
this distribution is StuQL 0.2, a sql query engine for the dynamic attribute 
sets (tables/entity) and attributes (table columns) you create with Stuki using
it's renderers to format any kind of text data.  Binary data is handled with 
plugins.  See Attachments\Attachments.  For instance, I created a GoogleDocs 
renderer to store the doc id in an EAV field on the form then when the value is 
rendered it replaces the data with an iframe.

Stuki can be used to catalog anything.  It's sparse data matrix makes it ultra-
light weight and creating attribute sets, attributes, and setting thier
relations couldn't be easier.  This can be thought of as a particular database written in php which is EAV, a proven pattern used in Magento.

Plugins enhance the data with features like favorite lists and attachments.  
(Favorites\Favorites and Attachments\Attachments).

Everything is modular Zend Framework 2 with Doctrine ORM database portability.
The application is 100% OO in PHP 5.3.
